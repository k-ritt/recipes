# Creamy Bacon Cheese Grits
###### November 3, 2012
###### Recipes, 


	* 8 slices Regular Bacon, Cut Into 1/2-inch Pieces
	* 1 whole Yellow Onion, Chopped
	* 2 cups Stone Ground Grits; The More Coarse, The Better!
	* 4 cups Low Sodium Chicken Broth
	* 2 cups Water
	* 2 cups Heavy Cream (sorry)
	* 1-1/2 cup Grated Cheese (Monterey Jack, Etc.)
	* 1 dash Cayenne, For Heat
	* Salt As Needed
	* Black Pepper To Taste



In a heavy pot, cook bacon over medium heat for a couple of minutes to render fat. Add onions and cook with bacon for a few minutes, or until bacon is chewy and onions are golden brown.

Add grits, chicken broth, and water. Stir together and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer, cover pot, and cook 30 to 40 minutes, stirring occasionally and making sure the liquid level is okay. If grits begin to get dry, add a little more warm broth.

After 30-40 minutes of cooking time, pour in cream. Cover pot and continue to simmer on very low heat for another 30 minutes, or until grits are done. Taste and add salt, pepper and cayenne to taste. Remove from heat and stir in grated cheese. Keep warm and serve.
