<h3>Method</h3>
1. Dissolve yeast in milk, and then add water.
2. Sift the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the bottom.
3. Add this mixture to the flour and salt.
4. Mix together to form a soft dough.
5. Knead the dough lightly in the bowl (I used a mixer), then cover with clear film and leave to ferment for 1 hour, or until doubled.
6. Grease 2 baking sheets or line the baking sheets with parchment paper.
7. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and deflate it slightly.
8. Divide the dough into 10 pieces. (Mine weighed 2 3/4 ounces / 75 grams.)
9. Knead lightly and, using a rolling pin, shape each piece to a flat oval 4 X 3 inches or a flat round 3 1/2 inches in diameter.
10. Transfer to the baking sheets, spaced well apart, and cover with oiled film.
11. Let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes.
12. Heat the oven to 400F.
13. Press each roll in the center / center with three fingers to equalize the air bubbles.
14. Brush with milk and dust with flour.
15. Bake for 15 -20 minutes, or until lightly browned.
16. Remove to a wire rack. Serve warm
