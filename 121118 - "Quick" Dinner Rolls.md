A yeast bread recipe using instant yeast.  Start to finish time is approximately 1 1/2 hrs.

* 1 package quick-acting active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons) ( 7 grams)
* 1 1/3 cup milk (105º to 115ºF degrees)
* 3 to 3 1/2 cups flour or whole wheat flour
* 3 tablespoons oil
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon melted butter
* coarse salt

Dissolve yeast in warm milk in electric mixer bowl. Stir in 1 cup flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour, oil, sugar and salt. Mix on low electric speed until soft dough forms. Cover and let rise in warm place until double, about 45 minutes.

Heat oven 400ºF degrees. Prep a 12 cup muffin pan with non-stick cooking spray.

Punch down dough in center and fold over a few times. Pinch off 1 inch balls of dough and quickly roll in palm of hands. Put 3 balls to one muffin cup; brush with melted butter; sprinkle with coarse salt.

Bake 12 to 15 minutes, until crust is light golden brown. Immediately remove from pan. Store loosely covered.
