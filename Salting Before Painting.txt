Title: Salting Before Painting

Kosher salt dissolves readily if salting silk BEFORE painting. Coarse salt, not at all.  Fine salt in quantity produced an effect.

Different salt coarseness does not appear when dye is applied.

A lot of salt, and probably wetted thoroughly (twice), can create more of a crackle texture.

No salt effect transpires when salt is applied after dye. (already too much salt on silk?)

Water drops were effective in some parts, not others?

Came out of steamer iridescent in some spots, others looked the same as before it was steamed.  There was hardly any dye on the paper even though there was a lot of dye on the silk.
