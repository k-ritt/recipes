1 cup Quinoa

1 tbsp. Extra Virgin Olive Oil

1 large onion, chopped

1 tbsp.  Minced Garlic

1 tbsp. chili powder

1 tbsp. Ground Cumin

1 tsp. Oregano Leaves

1 can (8 oz.)  Tomato Sauce

2 cans (15.5 oz. each)  Low Sodium Black Beans, drained and rinsed

½ large green pepper, seeded and diced

½ large red pepper, seeded and diced

1 tbsp.  Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce, finely chopped

1 can (15.5 oz.) Corn Kernels, drained and rinsed

Fresh cilantro

In a medium pot, bring quinoa, 1½ cups water and ½ of olive oil to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and let simmer for 20 minutes, until water is absorbed and quinoa is tender. Set aside.

Meanwhile, in a large pot, heat remaining olive oil on medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic, and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chili powder, cumin and oregano, and stir for about 1 minute. Stir in tomato sauce, black beans, green and red peppers, chipotle peppers and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil; then reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.

After 20 minutes, stir in reserved quinoa and corn. Cook for another 5 minutes. Serve and top with fresh cilantro sprigs.
