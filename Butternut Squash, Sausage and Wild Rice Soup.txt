Makes 8 to 12 servings.

3-4 lb. butternut squash, cut in half, seeds and strings removed
2 tbs. olive oil
3 qts. (12 c) chicken broth
2 1/2 cups chopped yellow onions
1 cup wild rice
3/4 lb. kielbasa, cut into small bite-size pieces (1/4 inch)
2 cups fresh or thawed frozen corn kernels (about 2 lg. Fresh ears)
1 tsp salt (if using homemade chicken stock, add more salt)
½ tsp. freshly ground pepper
2 tbs. minced fresh parsley
11/2 cups half and half

1.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees

2.  Rub the cut sides of the squash halves with 1 tbs. Olive oil.  Place on baking sheet, flesh side down, and roast until tender when pierced with the tip of a knife (45 min. to 1 hr.). [Can also peel and cube squash before roasting. May add a bit more of a roasted flavor]

3.  Let the squash cool and then scoop the flesh from the skin with a large spoon.  Puree the butternut flesh with 2 cups of the broth in a food processor of blender.

4.  Bring 2 1/2 cups of the broth and ½ cup of the chopped onions to a simmer in a large saucepan over med-hi heat.  Stir in the wild rice.  Return to a simmer, cover and cook until the rice is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed, 45 min. to 1 hr.  Set aside.

5.  Meanwhile, heat 1 tbs. olive oil over med-hi heat.  Add the sausage and cook until browned.  Add the remaining 2 cups onions, corn, salt, and pepper.  Cook, stirring often, until the onions are softened, about 4 min.  Add the remaining 6 cups broth and the squash puree and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to med-lo, cover and simmer for 20 min., stirring occasionally and skimming any fat that rises to the surface.

6.  Stir in the rice and cook for 5 minutes.  Stir in the half-and-half and parsley.  Let flavors meld for 15 minutes.  Serve.
