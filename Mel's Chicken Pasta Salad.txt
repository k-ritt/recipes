Updated recipe 08/14

1# ruffle or spiral pasta (cooked)
2 c (approx 1 #) chopped, cooked chicken
6-8 strips bacon, chopped, cooked, drained
2-3 c fresh spinach, julienne (I use more)
½ c ripe olives, optional
8oz Monterrey jack cheese, shredded

Dressing -- whisk together the following:

2 t dijon mustard
½ c tarragon vinegar (white tastes better than red)
1 c  oil (EVOO added too much flavor but may have been too much oil)
1 t salt
3/4 t pepper
¼ t sugar
½ t garlic powder

1.  Combine pasta through cheese in a very large bowl.

2.  Add dressing

&nbsp;

Note: tastes much best after flavors have combined overnight in fridge.  If you are preparing this ahead of time, do not add spinach until a couple of hours before you're ready to eat salad as it tends to get soggy.
