Or Gajar Matar

2 Tbs oil or Ghee (if sub butter, use unsalted)
2-3 Tbs Raw Broken Cashews
1 onion coarsley chopped
1 tsp salt
1 Tbs ginger-garlic paste
1 tsp turmeric
1 15-oz can diced tomatoes
1 tsp cumin seed
Whole garam masala (or 1 tsp dried garam masala)
1 green chili
1 tsp cumin powder
1 tsp coriander powder
1/2 tsp chili powder
1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves
2 cups green peas
Paneer or 2 cups cooked carrots
1 cup cream
Cayenne pepper

Heat butter or oil in pan and lightly sautee the cashew nuts until very light in color (do NOT overcook).

Add onion and salt to pan and cook until slightly brown in color.

Add turmeric and ginger-garlic paste.  Cook until the raw scent leaves.

Add chopped tomatoes and cook for a few minutes.

Blend or food process until a paste forms.

Heat more oil or ghee in the same pan.  Add whole garam masala (if using powder add with rest of spices later?), and cumin seeds.

Add tomato puree back into pan with some water.

Add chopped green chilis, cumin powder, coriander powder and chili powder (and garam masala if using spice blend) and bring to a boil.  Strong simmer for 15 minutes.  Add more water if it gets too thick during this time (but will be adding cream later so that will thin it out a bit).

Add fenugreek leaves and cook for another 10 minutes.

Remove from heat and let cool a bit.  Puree to make very smooth sauce.

Add cream and cook for 10 minutes. The longer it cooks the more the flavors will blend.

Add peas and cook for 5 minutes.

Add paneer or carrots.

Salt to taste and add cayenne pepper to add spicy heat.
