<p id="InstructionSet" class="group"><span id="Instructions">8) Bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes, until they're a light golden brown, with slightly darker edges. Their middles may still look a tiny bit shiny; that's OK, they'll continue to bake as they cool on the pan.</span></p>
<p id="InstructionSet" class="group"><span id="Instructions">9) Remove the cookies from the oven, and as soon as they're set enough to handle, transfer them to racks to cool.</span></p>
