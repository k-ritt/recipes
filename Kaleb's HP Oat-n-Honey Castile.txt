Title: Kaleb&#8217;s HP Oat-n-Honey Castile
Pub date: November 25, 2012
Category: Soap, 

Great for crock pot HP

32 oz. olive oil (not pomace)
3 oz. castor oil
4.50 oz. lye (about 5% superfatting)
12 oz. water

Add your oils to the preheating crock pot. Go ahead and dissolve your lye in the water. After the lye is fully dissolved, go ahead and add it to the oils. Stick blend to thick trace. Turn the crock up on 'high' and cover with a lid.

Check on the soap about every 10 minutes and stir well. Recover with lid.

After the soap has gone through the separation stage, then has gone through the rising up and turning in on itself stage (and looks like a cross between veseline and mashed taters) go ahead and do the knife test: stick a clean dry butter knife into the soap... if the soap looks waxy, go ahead and do a tongue test... if it still zaps, add an additional 1 teaspoon more of olive oil, stir it well and let it cook for about another two minutes.

Next: add the following:
3 tablespoons honey

Stir the honey into the cooking soap. It should immediately start to change colors, and will ultimately turn dark. It should sizzle a bit. Go ahead and turn off the crock.

Next: add the following:

3 tablespoons oat flour, mixed with about 3 or 4 tablespoons cold water to get all the lumps out (use your fingers to feel-out all the lumps).

Stir-in the oat flour mixture VERY WELL. Now you can go ahead and mold-up the soap. This amount of soap will fill a quart milk carton and a pint (half quart) milk carton.

Made 11/20/2012:
<ul>
	<li>High seemed ok on the crockpot.</li>
	<li>Stirred regularly (some say don't stir).</li>
	<li>Stirred the oat flour and water a little ahead of time, it was very thick by the time I tried to stir in.  Did not stir in well.  Maybe use 4 Tbs next time or don't do it ahead of time.</li>
	<li>Thickened up a fair amount as I  stirred in the oat flour (cooling down? accelerating? waited to long to stir it in?</li>
	<li>Fit nicely in wooden mold</li>
	<li>Cure for at least 8 weeks. Otherwise will be gloppy when used and run off brown.</li>
</ul>
