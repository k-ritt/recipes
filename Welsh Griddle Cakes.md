Title: Welsh Griddle Cakes

These lemon-flavored tea cakes, made with golden raisins or currants, have a deliciously crumbly texture and melt in your mouth. Tottie Parmeter, who grew up in Cardiff, learned how to make them from her mother, who often would serve the cakes warm with afternoon tea. “I always looked forward to these cakes, because my mother had such a deft hand with them,” she says. “And the smell of lemon, wafting up from the griddle, just made my mouth water.” Tottie’s mother used a combination of lard and butter. The lard contributes its own special flavor and makes the cakes especially tender. Use homemade lard or order a top-quality lard by mail. Or, if you wish, substitute butter for the lard.

This recipe dares back to the eighteenth century or earlier. In Wales, the cakes were traditionally cooked on a baketone, a heavy cast-iron sheet that was set on coals in the fireplace. Today most bakers use an electric griddle. The dough has barely enough liquid to hold it together, which accounts for the cakes’ sublime texture.

These griddle cakes are quick and easy to make. They cook in just a few minutes and are delicious with steaming-hot tea.

<h3>Directions</h3>

To make the dough by hand, put the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and lard, if using, and cut into the flour with a pastry blender or two knives until the fat particles are about the size of small peas. Reach into the bowl with both hands and rub the dry ingredients rapidly between your finger until the consistency is like coarse sand. For the best texture, the fat must be in very small pieces. Stir in the sugar, spices, raisins or currants, and lemon zest.

To make the dough using a food processor, in large bowl stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Insert the metal blade into the food processor, add about two-thirds of the dry ingredients to the work bowl, and scatter the fat on top. Pulse 5 or 6 times, then process continuously for about 10 seconds. Rub a little of the dry ingredients rapidly between your fingertips; the mixture should feel like fine meal. If necessary, process a few seconds longer. Add the contents of the work bowl to the flour in the mixing bowl and mix well. Stir in the sugar, spices, raisins or currants, and lemon zest. (From here on, follow the directions for the hand method.)

To make the dough using a stand mixer, put the flour, baking powder, salt, and fat into the mixer bowl and attach the flat beater. Beat on low speed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the mixture has the consistency of fine meal. Rub a little between your fingertips to make sure. Add the sugar, spices, raisins or currants, and lemon zest and mix on low speed for 30 seconds.

In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg with a fork. Beat in the lemon juice and milk.

To add the liquid by hand, scrape the liquid over the dry ingredients and begin stirring it in with the fork. Keep stirring and tossing until the dough forms medium to large clumps. It will seem to be quite dry. Reach into the bowl with both hands and, working quickly so as not to soften the fat, squeeze the dough together to form one mass that holds together. If the dough won’t hold together, sprinkle on droplets of additional milk and squeeze again. The key to the success of this recipe is to keep the liquid to a minimum.

To add the liquid using the mixer, scrape the liquid into the mixer bowl and mix on low speed just until the dough masses onto the beater.

To shape the griddle cakes, lightly flour your work surface, place the dough on it, and roll the dough about to coat it lightly with flour. Flatten the dough a bit and roll it out until it is about ½ inch thick. Don’t make it thicker, or the cakes will have to cook longer and they may brown too much. Stamp out circles with a sharp 2½-inch round cutter. Set the cakes on a baking sheet lined with plastic wrap. Gather the dough scraps, reroll, and cut out more cakes. Use all the dough; you may have to shape the last cake or two by hand.

Preheat a large electric nonstick griddle to 250° to 275°F <span style="color: #ff0000;">(or heavy cast-iron skillet)</span>. Add as many cakes as will fit comfortably, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until the cakes are a deep golden brown on their bottoms. Turn them over carefully with a pancake turner and cook them on the second side for 5 to 6 minutes, until completely cooked through. The tops will feel firm and the sides will have lost their softness; a toothpick inserted into a cake should come out clean. With a wide spatula, transfer the cakes to a wire cooling rack. While they are still hot, sprinkle each cake with a pinch of sugar. Continue with the remaining cakes the same way. Serve the cakes warm or at room temperature.
