<h4>Rolls</h4>

<h4>To make the biga (one to four days prior to baking the rolls):</h4>
<ol>
	* Place the yeast in a medium bowl and add the warm water. Let it stand until creamy.
	* Add the rest of the water and the flour and stir with a dough whisk or large spoon for about four minutes.

<h4>To make the rolls:</h4>

<ol>
	* Add the yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer and add the warm water. Let stand until creamy.
	* Add the biga and mix with the paddle until the biga is broken up.
	* Add the flour and salt and mix with the paddle attachment of your mixer until the ingredients come together.
	* Switch to the dough hook and knead on low for about 2 minutes. Switch to medium speed for 1 minute.Â  If you want, finish kneading briefly on a floured surface, you will probably need 1 to 2 Tbls of additional flour.
	* Place the dough into an oiled bowl or dough rising bucket, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
	* Place the dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 16 equal pieces.
	* Form the pieces into balls and then with the floured handle of a wooden spoon or the edge of your hand make a deep indentation down the center of each ball.
	* Place the rolls, cleft side down, onto a well-floured surface. Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
	* Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
	* Just before baking, turn each roll over and reemphasize the cleft.
	* Place the rolls, cleft side up, on lightly oiled or parchment lined baking sheets.
	* Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, spraying the oven with water three times during the first ten minutes.
	* Cool the rolls on a wire rack.
