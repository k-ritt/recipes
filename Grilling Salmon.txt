 	* Build a medium-high fire on a clean gas or charcoal grill. (If the grill isn't clean, the salmon will stick to the grate.)
 	* Season the salmon with salt and pepper, lightly oil the grate of the grill, then place the fillets skin-side up over the fire and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes, until lightly browned.
 	* Gently flip the salmon over and cook 3 to 4 minutes more for medium rare. You can cook a little longer if you'd like, but take care not to overcook.
