2 cups bread flour or strong white flour or all purpose flour i*(240 grams)*
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp salt
1 tsp active yeast
2 tbsp ghee (28 grams)
5 tbsp yogurt (71 grams stoneyfield plain whole milk yogurt)
1/2 cup lukewarm water

*I use bread flour whenever I have it around because it creates much better naan but when I don't all purpose flour works just fine. Sometimes I also use 1 cup chapati flour instead of all white flour for nuttier flavor.i*

**Method**

Mix the water, yeast and sugar and leave for 10 minutes for the yeast to come alive. It’s necessary that you don't get confused between a yeast that mixes and rises to the top and an yeast which actually proofs with bubbles of air forming.

Add salt to the flour and keep aside. Once the yeast has proofed, add it to the flour along with yogurt and ghee. Knead the dough well for about 10 minutes. The dough may feel sticky at first, apply some ghee on your hand and keep kneading till it’s soft and supple. Keep it in a greased bowl covered with wet towel to rise.  It may take any where between 2-3 hours to rise.

Once it rises, knead it for another 5 minutes and divide it into equal size balls. If you want to make garlic or cumin flavored naan, add it while kneading the dough at this point.

Roll each piece into a flat ball. *( Let rest for 10 minutes)*

Dust the work surface with flour and start rolling the balls with a rolling pin.  After the intial rolling it become much easier to handle it with hands.

Try to give it a tear drop shape by stretching it from one end. Don't stretch too much as it may tear.

Heat the skillet on high heat for 3 minutes. Put this rolled naan on the skillet and cover with a lid. In less than a minute bubbles with pop up.  Reduce the gas to medium high, flip the naan on the other side and cook for few seconds till the bubbles char. Alternatively, with tongs take the naan and put the other side on an open flame to cook and char the bubbles. Naan cooks very quickly at this point so don't let it be on flame for more than 30 seconds.

Brush immediately with butter and sprinkle with chopped coriander leaves.
