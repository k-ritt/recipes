<div>3 c all purpose, unbleached flour or bread flour</div>
<div>.25 t instant yeast</div>
<div>1.5t salt</div>
<div>1.5 c water (warm or cold is fine)</div>
<div></div>
<div>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, yeast and salt. Give it a quick stir to incorporate.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Pour in the water, and with a spoon, stir until blended and all the flour is incorporated. The dough will be rough and shaggy, almost like a scone dough, and fairly sticky. This step needs to only take one minute.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit out on the counter for at least 12 hours and up to 24, I baked mine around 14 hours. No need for a “warm” spot, room temperature is fine. The warmer your kitchen though, the quicker the rise.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The dough will be ready when the surface is level and bubbly.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Preheat the oven to 450˚ (<span style="color: #993300;">425 in my oven</span>), with the enamel pot inside, and with the lid on.</div>
<div></div>
<div>While the oven is heating, turn the dough out onto a well floured surface. The dough will be VERY sticky and stringy. With well floured hand, fold the dough a few times over onto itself, and then shape it into a ball. Other shapes work well too, btw, such as a longer loaf (rolls anyone?)</div>
<div></div>
<div>The shaping of the dough should only take a minute or two. No need to knead.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you’re using parchment, dust the paper and lay the dough on top. Other wise, let the dough rest on a well floured surface for an additional 30 minutes. Cover with the plastic wrap.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Note: the oven will come to temperature well before the dough has risen, but you really want the enamel pan to be super hot, so that extra heating time is perfect.</div>
<div></div>
<div>About 20 minutes after you have shaped the dough, using a sharp or serrated knife, make cuts about .75″ deep into the top of the bread. Then let rest the final 10 minutes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>When ready, open the oven and remove the lid of the pot with a cloth or potholder. Either lift the parchment paper, or with well floured hands, carefully lift the dough and lay it into the pot. There is no need to grease the pan. It absolutely will not stick.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Using the potholder, replace the pan lid and slide the pot back into the oven and bake for 30 minutes, then remove the lid and bake for another 15 until the bread is browned and beautiful.</div>
<div></div>
<div>When ready, I use a cloth and simply grab the bread out of the pot and place it on a wire rack to cool.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Because the pot is so heavy and hot, I simply leave it in the oven and let it cool in the turned off oven. Alternatively you can carefully remove the pot from the oven and allow it to cool. Warning* the lid, after you’ve removed from the oven will retain its heat for quite awhile, so please use protection when handling it until you are quite sure it is cool.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It’s tempting to want to cut into the loaf right out of the oven, but it’s better to give it a several minutes to cool. During that time you can sit back and revel in your handiwork, and enjoy the music of the crust making crackling noises.</div>
