1 beef eye round roast
olive oil
freshly cracked black pepper
kosher salt
garlic powder
onion powder
<h2>Season the meat</h2>
Preheat your oven to 500 degrees (or convection 475). Line a sheet pan or roasting pan with foil. Put a roasting rack in the pan on top of the foil. Set aside.

Grab your roast out of the fridge. Give it a quick rinse under cold water. Pat it completely dry.

Drizzle the meat with a little olive oil. This is imprecise. Use enough oil to coat your roast completely.

With your hands, rub the meat on all sides to coat with oil. Sprinkle evenly with freshly cracked black pepper.  Be sure to get underneath and on the ends, too

Sprinkle all sides with kosher salt, to taste.

Dust all sides with garlic powder and onion powder.

When your roast is completely seasoned, pat it down with your hands to help the spices adhere.

When your roast is seasoned, place it on the rack in your prepared pan.

<strong>Roast at 500 degrees (or convection 475) for 20 minutes. Then drop temperature to 300 degrees (or convection 275) for another 30 minutes.(May need a bit less time with convection)
</strong>

<strong>For a medium rare roast, your meat should be in the oven for a total of 50 minutes cooking time. If you’d like it rare, pull it out sooner. If you’d like it more well done, leave it in a little longer. </strong>

Here’s that temperature chart again:

120 F = rare
126 F = medium-rare
134 F = medium
150 F = medium-well
160 F = well done

After 50 minutes in the oven, my roast registered about 126 degrees or so. (To check the temperature, stick a meat thermometer into the center of your roast.  Check a couple of different spots)

Loosely tent a piece of foil over the meat for about 20 minutes when it comes out of the oven.

After it’s rested for 20 minutes, it’s ready to slice across the grain.

Slice it as thinly as you can with a very sharp knife.
