Make sure to use leftover, day old rice when making fried rice. Freshly made rice will make a fried rice that's mushy.

Chinese Sausage
<span style="color: #000000;"> 8 ounces small raw shrimp, shelled and deveined (or chicken sliced very thin and small)</span>
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons cooking oil, divided
3 eggs, beaten
4 stalks green onion, minced
2 cloves garlic
4 cups leftover rice, grains separated well
3/4 cup frozen peas and carrots, defrosted
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon sesame oil

<strong></strong>1.  In a bowl, toss the shrimp with the salt, pepper and cornstarch. Let marinate for 10 minutes at room temperature.

2.  Render about 1 Tbs of fat from the chinese sausage in a wok over medium heat.

3.  Heat a wok or large sauté pan on high heat. When the pan is hot enough for a bead of water to instantly sizzle and evaporate<strong>.</strong>

4.  Add the shrimp (or chicken), quickly spreading out around the cooking surface area so that they are not overlapping. Let fry, untouched for 30 seconds. Flip over and let the other side fry for 30 seconds, or until about 80% cooked through. Remove the shrimp (chicken) from the pan onto a plate, leaving as much oil in the pan as possible.

5.  Turn the heat to medium, let the pan heat up again. Add the eggs, stirring in a quick motion to break up and scramble the eggs. When the eggs are almost cooked through (they should still be slightly runny in the middle), dish out of the pan into the same plate as the cooked shrimp. <strong></strong>

6.  Use paper towels to wipe the same wok or sauté pan clean and return to high heat with the remaining 1 tablespoon of cooking oil, swirling to coat. When the oil is very hot, add the green onions and garlic and fry until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add in the rice and stir well to mix in the green onions throughout. Spread the rice all around the wok surface area and let the rice heat up, untouched until you hear the bottoms of the grains sizzle, about 1-2 minutes. Use the spatula to toss the rice, again spreading the rice out over the surface of wok.

7.  Drizzle the soy sauce and fish sauce all around the rice and toss. Add the peas and carrots, the cooked eggs, shrimp (chicken) and sesame oil, tossing to mix the rice evenly with all of the ingredients. Let everything heat back up again, until the rice grains are so hot they practically dance! Taste and add an additional 1 teaspoon of soy sauce if needed.

Yield: Serves 4.

Notes:
<ul>
	<li>Chicken needs to be warm in order not to stick (can place in warm water just before tossing with salt, pepper, etc)</li>
	<li>Eggs stuck so make sure there is some fat in the pan</li>
	<li>Cook rice to be drier than recipe calls for</li>
	<li>Make larger recipe for more leftovers</li>
	<li>Didn't love carrots</li>
	<li>Try broccoli</li>
	<li>Try jasmine rice</li>
</ul>
