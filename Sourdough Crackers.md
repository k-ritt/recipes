1/2 teaspoon sea salt

	<li id="InstructionSet" class="recipe-instrux-li"><span id="Instructions">Mix together the flour, salt, sourdough starter, butter, and optional herbs to make a smooth(not sticky), cohesive dough. </span></li>
	<li id="InstructionSet" class="recipe-instrux-li"><span id="Instructions">Divide the dough in half, and shape each half into a small rectangular slab. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or up to a couple of hours, until the dough is firm. </span></li>
	<li id="InstructionSet" class="recipe-instrux-li"><span id="Instructions">Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.</span></li>
	<li id="InstructionSet" class="recipe-instrux-li"><span id="Instructions">Very lightly flour a piece of parchment, your rolling pin, and the top of the dough. </span></li>
	<li id="InstructionSet" class="recipe-instrux-li"><span id="Instructions">Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough to about 1/16" thick. The dough will have ragged, uneven edges; that's OK. Just try to make it as even as possible. </span></li>
	<li id="InstructionSet" class="recipe-instrux-li"><span id="Instructions">Transfer the dough and parchment together onto a baking sheet. Lightly brush with oil and then sprinkle the salt over the top of the crackers.</span></li>
	<li id="InstructionSet" class="recipe-instrux-li"><span id="Instructions"> Cut the dough into 1 1/4" squares; a rolling pizza wheel works well here.</span></li>
	<li id="InstructionSet" class="recipe-instrux-li"><span id="Instructions">Prick each square with the tines of a fork.</span></li>
	<li id="InstructionSet" class="recipe-instrux-li"><span id="Instructions">Bake the crackers for about 20 minutes, until the squares are starting to brown around the edges.</span></li>
	<li id="InstructionSet" class="recipe-instrux-li"><span id="Instructions">When fully browned, remove the crackers from the oven, and transfer them to a cooling rack. Store airtight at room temperature for up to a week; freeze for longer storage.</span></li>
	<li id="InstructionSet" class="recipe-instrux-li"><span id="Instructions">Yield: about 100 crackers, 20 servings. </span></li>
