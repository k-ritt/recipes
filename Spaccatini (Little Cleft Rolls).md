<h4>Rolls</h4>

<h4>To make the biga (one to four days prior to baking the rolls):</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Place the yeast in a medium bowl and add the warm water. Let it stand until creamy.</li>
	<li>Add the rest of the water and the flour and stir with a dough whisk or large spoon for about four minutes.</li>
	<li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit room temperature overnight (up to 24 hours). If you are not using it after 24 hours, refrigerate it until you are ready to make the rolls.</li>

<h4>To make the rolls:</h4>
<div>
<ol>
	<li>Add the yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer and add the warm water. Let stand until creamy.</li>
	<li>Add the biga and mix with the paddle until the biga is broken up.</li>
	<li>Add the flour and salt and mix with the paddle attachment of your mixer until the ingredients come together.</li>
	<li>Switch to the dough hook and knead on low for about 2 minutes. Switch to medium speed for 1 minute.Â  If you want, finish kneading briefly on a floured surface, you will probably need 1 to 2 Tbls of additional flour.</li>
	<li>Place the dough into an oiled bowl or dough rising bucket, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</li>
	<li>Place the dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 16 equal pieces.</li>
	<li>Form the pieces into balls and then with the floured handle of a wooden spoon or the edge of your hand make a deep indentation down the center of each ball.</li>
	<li>Place the rolls, cleft side down, onto a well-floured surface. Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
	<li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
	<li>Just before baking, turn each roll over and reemphasize the cleft.</li>
	<li>Place the rolls, cleft side up, on lightly oiled or parchment lined baking sheets.</li>
	<li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, spraying the oven with water three times during the first ten minutes.</li>
	<li>Cool the rolls on a wire rack.</li>
