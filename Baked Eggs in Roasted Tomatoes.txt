1/2 tsp basil

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Mix together the olive oil, sliced tomatoes, basil, crushed red pepper, garlic, and sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, to tastes, in the small mixing bowl.

Divide into two individual serving dishes (ie ramekins).  Place into the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until tomatoes looked roasted.

Remove from the oven and crack the egg(s) into the dish, being careful not to break the yolk (unless you don't like yolky eggs, then use a knife to break the yolk).  Add the milk, cheese, and season with more sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste.

Place onto a baking tray and cook for 13-15 minutes or until the whites set but the yolks are still soft. Remove from the oven and serve with toast if desired.
