<ul>
	<li>6 whole Boneless Pork Chops, About 1/2-inch Thick [Try pork tenderloin (cut into medallions) for juicer more flavorful pork]</li>
	<li>2 Tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
	<li>2 Tablespoons Butter</li>
	<li>2 whole Gala Apples, Diced</li>
	<li>1/2 cup Dry White Wine</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
	<li>3/4 cups Pure Maple Syrup</li>
	<li>1 dash Salt</li>
	<li>Freshly Ground Black Pepper</li>
	<li>Creamy Bacon-Cheese Grits (see My Tasty Kitchen Recipe)</li>
</ul>
Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and butter and heat until butter in melted.

Salt and pepper both sides of pork chops. Brown them on both sides until nice and golden. Remove pork chops from the skillet and set on a separate plate.

Reduce heat to medium. Add apples and stir to combine them with the oil, and butter that remains in the pan. Pour in wine and vinegar, then whisk along the bottom of the pan to deglaze it. Cook until liquid is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Pour in the maple syrup, then add a dash of salt and pepper. Stir, then return pork chops to the pan. Cover the pan and simmer on low for 20 minutes.

Serve pork chops on top of a generous helping of Creamy Cheese Grits (mashed potatoes are good, too) and spoon the apple-maple sauce over the top, allowing the liquid to drip over the grits.
