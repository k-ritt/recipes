<strong>Step 1: </strong>Measure the length of the <strong>inside</strong> of your soap mold. Make sure that you are 100% exact!

<strong>Step 2: </strong>Take out your heavy duty freezer paper and cut a piece that is the length of your mold plus another 10 inches. For example: my mold that I'm using for this tutorial has a 13 inch inside length, so I cut my piece of freezer paper so that it's 23 inches long... 13 inches (length of mold) + extra 10 inches = 23 inches total length for the freezer paper. From this point on remember to always keep the glossy side of the paper up.

<strong>Step 3: </strong>Fold only the left side of the freezer paper so that the flap is 5 inches long.

<strong>Step 4: </strong>Place the wax paper on top of your mold with the left folded side lined up with the left inside end of the soap mold. Now fold the right side so that the piece of wax paper fits lengthwise perfectly into your mold.

<strong>Step 5:</strong> Place the Paper into the mold. It should fit perfectly! Now cut the freezer paper to reduce its width so that it will fold over each long side by about 2 inches.

<strong>Step 6:</strong> With your fingers, crease the freezer paper at the bottom of the mold against the corners.

<strong>Step 7:</strong> Once you've made your initial creases, Take out the freezer paper and re-crease it even stronger.

<strong>Step 8:</strong> cut out small squares in each corner leaving about 1 inch of paper on each side.

<strong>Step 9:</strong> Place the wax paper back into the mold and pull up the long tabs in the middle so that the wax paper takes on the wooden soap mold's form.

<strong>Step 10:</strong> Cut a sliver in the paper to the top of the mold at each corner. This will allow the wax paper to fold over the sides without tearing during the next steps.

<strong>Step 11:</strong> Tape the wax paper in place on the long sides.

<strong>Step 12:</strong> Tape the wax paper in place on the short ends.

<strong>Step 13:</strong> Now all you have to do is Make sure that all the corners are well defined and that there's no loose wax paper within the mold.
