#### Ingredients:

* 2-4 slices bacon
* 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced
* 1 jalapeno, thinly sliced
* 1 zucchini, thinly sliced
* 1 cup fresh corn kernels
* Coarse salt
* 8 large eggs

Heat broiler. In a medium ovenproof (preferably cast-iron) skillet, cook bacon over medium heat.Â  Remove bacon (and maybe some of the drippings depending on how much was rendered) and cook onion and jalapeno in bacon drippings, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add zucchini and corn and cook until tender, about 7 minutes more. Season with salt.

In a bowl, whisk eggs with 1/2 teaspoon salt and pour into skillet with vegetables. Cook until sides are just beginning to set, 2 to 3 minutes.

Transfer skillet to oven and broil until just set in the middle and lightly golden and puffed on top, 2 to 3 minutes.

#### Notes:

use pan that distributes heat well (so middle cooks)
