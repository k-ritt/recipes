###### Recipes, Vegetable, 

Serves 2, generously

1/2 pound fresh green beans, trimmed, washed and dried
1 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Zest of 1 lemon
Juice of 1/2 lemon
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 tablespoons capers, optional
Salt
freshly ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 425.

Place jelly roll pan in oven to heat up for 10 min.

Meanwhile, toss green beans with rest of the ingredients leaving half of the zest to sprinkle on top after baking.

Remove pan from oven and place green beans in a single layer on hot baking sheet.

Bake for 5 minutes then shake pan to ensure even baking.

Bake for another 5-10 minutes depending on how you like your green beans.Â  I took mine out at 8 minutes.

Sprinkle with reserved lemon zest and additional salt if needed.

Serve.
