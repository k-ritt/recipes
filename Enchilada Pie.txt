Tags: Dinner, Casserole, Quick, Vegetarian

12 ounce bottle of enchilada sauce (or make 2 minute enchilada sauce)

2 minute Enchilada Sauce
  14.5 ounce can diced tomatoes (preferably fire roasted)
  ¼ cup water
  2 Tablespoons olive oil
  2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
  1 teaspoon cumin
  2 teaspoons chili powder
  ¼-½ teaspoon chipotle powder – optional (plus more to taste, or add a canned chipotle pepper, or smoked paprika and cayenne for heat)     
  2 garlic cloves (or 2 teaspoons granulated garlic)
  1 ½ teaspoon kosher salt
  1 teaspoon oregano- optional (dry or fresh)

 8 x 6 inch corn tortillas
 2 x 15 ounce cans seasoned black beans (0r substitute half with cooked chicken, browned and seasoned ground meat or ground turkey, or chorizo) *(I used a small amount of enchilada sauce and hot sauce on pre-cooked chicken)*
 16 ounce bag frozen corn ( fire roasted is nice) – or sub fresh corn
 2 cups grated Mexican style cheese blend – or cotijo or grated grated jack cheese or similar **I used pepper jack and cheddar**
 4 ounce can green chilies, preferably fire roasted (optional)
 Garnish: chopped cilantro, diced avocado, sour cream, hot sauce *(really good with avocado, sour cream and salsa)*


    Preheat oven to 400 F
    Make the Quick Enchilada Sauce. Place all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.
    In a greased 9 x13 inch baking dish, spread out a third of the sauce or less– just enough to lightly coat the bottom.
    Spread out 4 tortillas on top of the sauce.
    Drain one can of seasoned beans, and spread out over the tortillas. (Drain well)
    Spread out half of the frozen roasted corn.
    Spread out 1 cup of the shredded cheese
    Scatter ½ of the canned green chilies and a little chopped cilantro.
    Then repeat with another can of drained seasoned beans (or substitute cooked chicken breast, or browned & seasoned ground meat- turkey, chicken or beef )
    Top with rest of the corn, the cheese, the chilies and cilantro.
    Drizzle with ⅓ of the sauce and top with 4 more tortillas.
    Spread the remaining sauce over the tortillas.
    Cover and bake for 30 minutes.
    Uncover, and bake 10 more minutes, adding more cheese if you want so it melts.
    Garnish with diced avocado, cilantro and sour cream.
