Instead of breadcrumbs, this mac and cheese is topped with rich, pungent caramelized shallots and creamy, crumbled goat cheese.

Yield: Makes 6 servings

#### Ingredients:

* 3 tablespoons butter plus more for baking dish
* 3 cups sliced large shallots (about 6)
* 8 ounces small elbow macaroni (2 cups)
* 1 1/4 cups half and half
* 2 1/2 teaspoons hot sauce (such as Cholula)
* 2 cups (packed) coarsely grated extra sharp cheddar cheese (about 8 ounces)
* 1 1/2 tablespoons all purpose flour
* 2/3 cup crumbled soft fresh goat cheese

Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter 11x7x2-inch glass baking dish. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and cook 5 minutes, stirring often. Reduce heat to medium. Cook, covered, until shallots are deep brown, stirring often, about 6 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook macaroni in large saucepan of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally; drain well. Reserve pan. Bring half and half and hot sauce to simmer in same saucepan over medium heat. Toss cheddar cheese and flour in medium bowl to coat; add to half and half mixture. Whisk until sauce is smooth and just returns to simmer, about 2 minutes. Mix in pasta. Season with salt and pepper.

Spread pasta mixture in prepared dish. Top with shallots, then goat cheese. Sprinkle with pepper. Bake until heated through, about 15 minutes.

#### Notes:

I use Fiori pasta rather than elbow macaroni and Vidalia sweet onions rather than shallots and about twice what they call for, If it's too much you can leave them off.

Bill says don’t need to use hot sauce or can use just a little.
