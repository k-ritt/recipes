This is a double recipe that makes enough meatballs to freeze for later use.

4 slices white sandwich bread (crusts discarded), torn into small cubes
1 cup buttermilk or 12 tablespoons plain yogurt thinned with 4 tablespoons sweet milk
1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck ( or 2 pound if omitting ground pork below)
1/2 pound ground pork (to be mixed with ground chuck)
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
4 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves
2 large egg yolk
2 small clove garlic , minced (2 teaspoon)
1 1/2 teaspoon table salt
Ground black pepper
Vegetable oil for pan-frying (about 1 1/4 cups)

1.  Combine bread and buttermilk in small bowl, mashing occasionally with fork, until smooth paste forms, about 10 minutes.

2. Mix all meatball ingredients, including bread mixture and pepper to taste in medium bowl. Lightly form 3 tablespoons of mixture into 1 1/2-inch round meatballs; repeat with remaining mixture to form approximately 14 meatballs. (Compacting them can make the meatballs dense and hard. Can be placed on large plate, covered loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerated for several hours.)

3. Meanwhile, heat 1/4 -inch vegetable oil over medium-high heat in 10- or 11-inch sauté pan. When edge of meatball dipped in oil sizzles, add meatballs in single layer. Fry, turning several times, until nicely browned on all sides, about 10 minutes, regulating heat as needed to keep oil sizzling but not smoking. Transfer browned meatballs to paper towel--lined plate; set aside. Repeat, if necessary, with remaining meatballs. Or, to cook in oven, place on foil lined cookie sheet and bake at 450 convection checking temp at 8 minutes.
