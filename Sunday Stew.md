## Mashed Potatoes
* 5 pounds Russet Potatoes (peeled)

* 1 stick Butter, Softened
* ½ cups Heavy Cream
* 1 teaspoon Seasoned Salt

Salt and pepper stew meat. Heat olive oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add butter, and as soon as it melts, brown half the stew meat until the outside gets nice and brown, about 2 minutes. (Turn it as it browns.) Remove the meat from the pot with a slotted spoon and put it on a plate. Add the rest of the meat to the pot and brown it, too. Remove it to the same plate. Set the meat aside.

Add the onion and garlic to the pot, stirring it to coat it in all the brown bits in the bottom of the pot. Cook for two minutes, then add the tomato paste to the pot. Stir it into the onions and let it cook for two more minutes.

Pour in the beef stock, stirring constantly. Add a little salt and pepper, the Worcestershire and sugar. Add the beef back to the pot, bring a boil and then cover the pot, and reduce the heat to low. Simmer, covered, for 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours.  Chop carrots, parsnips and turnip.

After 1 1/2 to 2 hours, add the diced vegies to the pot. Stir to combine, put the lid back on the pot, and let it simmer for another 30 minutes. The sauce should be very thick, but if it seems overly so, splash in some beef broth until it thins it up enough. Feel free to add beef broth as needed.  If it needs some thickening, add a tablespoon of cornstarch to some cold water, add to the pot while stirring constantly with the stew at a boil

When the vegies are tender, stir in minced parsley. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed. Serve piping hot in a bowl with mashed potatoes, letting the juice run all over everything. Sprinkle with extra minced parsley at the end.

Mashed Potatoes

Cut the potatoes into quarters and cover with water in a large pot. Boil until potatoes are fork tender, about 25-30 minutes (Mine took only 15 as the pieces were smaller).  Drain the potatoes, then put them back into the same pot. With the heat on low, mash the potatoes for 2 to 3 minutes to release as much steam as possible.

Turn off heat, then add cream cheese, butter, cream, seasoned salt, salt and pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.

Serve potatoes immediately or spread them into a buttered baking dish to be reheated later. To reheat, put them in a 375 degree oven, covered in foil, until hot.
