###### Dessert, Recipes, 

150 grams 70% dark chocolate
100 grams butter
100 grams unsweetened cocoa powder
100 ml milk
150 ml cream
300 grams sugar

US Recipe:
5-1/2 ounces 70% dark chocolate
7 Tbs butter
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup plus 2 Tbs heavy cream
1 1/3 cups sugar

In the top of a double-boiler, gently melt together the chocolate and the butter.  Add the cocoa powder, and whisk to combine

Ina  medium saucepan, heat milk, cream and sugar, stirring until the mixture boils.

Add the hot milk mixture to the chocolate in several small additions--this will look like a mess at first, clumpy and goopy, but just keep whisking with confidence, and it will all come right in the end.  Keep stirring until the sauce is smooth and shiny.

The hot fudge keeps in the fridge for weeks; it also freezes beautifully.  Reheat in the microwave or in a hot-water bath.
