4 Tbs extra-virgin olive oil
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, 5-6 ounces, pounded evenly to half their original thickness
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
4 slices prosciutto, about 2 ounces
2 small bunches arugula, cut crosswise into 1/2 inch strips, discarding stems
1 medium to large tomato, about 12 ounces, core and cut into thin wedges
8 fresh basil leaves, chopped
1 Tbs balsamic vinegar, or high-quality red wine vinegar
4 fresh sage leaves, chopped or ½ tsp dried sage leaves, crushed
½ cup dry white wine

Put 2 Tbs of the olive oil in a large enough skillet to hold all of the chicken without crowding.  Put the skillet over medium heat.  Season the chicken with salt and pepper.  Press a slice of proscuitto onto each of the breast halves, then dredge the breast halves in flour, shaking off any excess.

Raise the heat under the skillet to medium-high and add the chicken, proscuitto side down.  Cook for 5 minutes on one side. Turn the chicken over and cook for three minutes.  Sprinkle the sage on top of the chicken, add the wine and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through and opaque.  Remove the chicken onto a serving platter.

Raise the heat to high under the skillet and stir the wine often with a wooden spoon, scraping the bits from the bottom of the pan.  Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced and lightly thickened to create a sauce.

Put the remaining 2 Tbs of olive oil, the vinegar and salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl and mix well with a whisk.

Put the arugula and tomato in a large mixing bowl, sprinkle with basil and toss with the dressing.  Pour the sauce over the chicken and serve with the salad.
