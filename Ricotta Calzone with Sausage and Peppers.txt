<h4>Makes six 9 by 4-Inch</h4>
To make this recipe, you will need a standing mixer or food processor, parchment paper, and a pizza stone. The stone must heat for an additional 30 minutes once the oven has come up to temperature; if your oven heats slowly, begin heating it about an hour into the dough’s first rise. Leftover calzones must be refrigerated; to reheat, heat the oven with the pizza stone just as you did when making the recipe, then set the calzones on the hot pizza stone for about 10 minutes. A simple tomato sauce is a nice accompaniment to the calzones.

Dough
4cups bread flour (22 ounces) plus additional for dusting work surface
2 1/4teaspoons instant yeast (1 envelope)
1 1/2teaspoons table salt
2tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/2cups water plus 1 tablespoon (12 1/2 ounces), 105 degrees

Filling
8ounces hot or sweet Italian sausage
12ounces bell peppers, sliced or chopped
3medium cloves garlic , pressed through garlic press or minced (about 1 tablespoon)
2tablespoons olive oil
1/4teaspoon red pepper flakes
15ounces whole-milk ricotta (1 container)
8ounces shredded fresh mozzarella (2 cups)
1 1/2ounces grated Parmesan cheese (about 3/4 cup)
1 large egg yolk
1tablespoon minced fresh oregano leaves
1/4teaspoon table salt
1/8teaspoon ground black pepper
Extra-virgin olive oil for brushing shaped calzones
Kosher salt for sprinkling

1. FOR THE DOUGH (see below for food processor method): In bowl of standing mixer, whisk flour, yeast, and salt to combine. Attach bowl and dough hook to mixer; with mixer running at medium-low speed, add olive oil, then gradually add water; continue to mix until mixture comes together and smooth, elastic dough forms, about 10 minutes. Lightly spray large bowl with nonstick cooking spray; form dough into ball, transfer it to bowl, cover bowl with plastic wrap lightly sprayed with nonstick cooking spray, and let rise in warm spot until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

2. FOR THE FILLING: While dough rises, combine cheeses, egg yolk, oregano, salt,and black pepper in medium bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until needed.
Remove casing from sausage and cook in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat, stirring constantly with wooden spoon and breaking sausage into 1/2-inch pieces, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes; stir in 1 tablespoon pressed or minced garlic and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Stir in peppers, 1 tablespoon water, and 1/8 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring constantly, until peppers are tender-crisp and water has evaporated, about 4 minutes. Transfer mixture to large paper towel-lined plate and cool to room temperature; once cooled, pat with paper towels to absorb excess moisture and set aside until needed.

4. Adjust oven rack to lowest position, set pizza stone on oven rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment paper and spray parchment lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Turn risen dough out onto unfloured work surface. Divide dough in half, then cut each half into thirds. Gently reshape each piece of dough into ball. Transfer to baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap lightly sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Let dough rest at least 15 minutes but no more than 30 minutes.

5. Cut eight 9-inch squares of parchment paper. Working with one piece of dough at a time and keeping other pieces covered, follow illustration 1 to roll dough into 9-inch round. Set round onto parchment square and cover with another parchment square; roll out another dough ball, set dough round on top of first, and cover with parchment square. Repeat to form stack of 3 rounds, covering top round with parchment square. Form second stack of 3 with remaining dough balls and parchment squares.

6. Remove top parchment square from first stack of dough rounds and place rounds with parchment beneath on work surface; if dough rounds have shrunk, gently and evenly roll out again to 9-inch rounds. To form the calzones, place scant 1/2 cup cheese filling in center of bottom half of dough round. Using small spatula, spread/press filling in even layer across bottom half of dough round, leaving 1-inch border uncovered.  Divide the sausage mixture evenly into 6 portions on plate; place 1 portion sausage mixture on top of cheese filling on dough round and follow illustrations 2 through 6. With pastry brush, brush tops and sides of calzones with olive oil and lightly sprinkle with salt. Trim excess parchment paper; slide calzones on parchment onto pizza peel or rimless baking sheet, then slide calzones with parchment onto hot pizza stone, evenly spacing them apart. Bake until golden brown, about 11 minutes; use pizza peel or rimless baking sheet to remove calzones with parchment to wire rack. Remove parchment, cool 5 minutes, and serve. While first batch bakes, form second batch and bake after removing first batch.

With floured rolling pin, roll outward from center in all directions until dough forms 9-inch circle. If dough sticks, dust flour under it.
