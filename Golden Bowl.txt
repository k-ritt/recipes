2-3 servings

1 15-ounce block of firm tofu
Vegetable oil
Soy sauce
Nutritional yeast
Sauteed vegetables (bell peppers, red onions, carrots, red cabbage, broccoli)
Sharp white cheddar
Brown rice

To prepare tofu:
Cut tofu into cubes slightly smaller than playing dice. Lightly oil a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> non-stick</span> skillet and place over high heat. Allow oil to heat slightly and add tofu. Saute, tossing with a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">non-metal</span> spatula until evenly and lightly golden brown. Sprinkle lightly with soy sauce. Saute briefly to further brown tofu. Remove from skillet, draining and discarding any excess fluid.

Rinse and wipe skillet dry, lightly oil and place it over high heat. Allow oil to become very hot and add tofu. Saute tofu, tossing with a non-metal spatula almost constantly until very well browned. Sprinkle with soy sauce to taste. Sprinkle with nutritional yeast to coat tofu cubes and, tossing vigorously, saute for a few seconds and remove from heat. Serve immediately.

note: personal tastes with regards to salty soy sauce flavor and amount of nutritional yeast "breading" vary widely. excessive soy sauce will make the tofu too salty, while too much oil and yeast will give a gooey result. at its best, this recipe yields tofu with a slightly crispy, deliciously yeasty exterior and a tender, moist interior.

To assemble the Golden Bowl:
