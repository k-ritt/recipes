4 large eggs
1 # small green beans, preferably haricots verts
1 clove garlic
12 large basil leaves
1 Tbs Dijon mustard
Freshly ground pepper
6 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil
2 Tbs. red wine vinegar
5 ounces mesclun or other salad mix, about 5 cups
3 6-ounce cans tuna packed in olive oil
2 medium ripe tomatoes, cut into wedges
30 black olives, preferably oil-cured

Hard boil eggs.  Cool, peel and halve lengthwise.

Cook green beans until just tender.  Drain and rinse with cool water to cool.

In a food processor, puree garlic.  Scrape down sides of bowl.  Add basil, mustard, and salt and pepper to taste.  With the motor running, gradually add the oil and the vinegar through the chute and process until the dressing is combined.

Put the salad greens on a large platter.  Place the tuna in the middle of the greens.  Put the beans in 4 bundles radiating out from the tuna, like spokes.  Put the tomato wedges in between the bundles.  Scatter the olives all around.  Place the eggs, cut side up, throughout the platter.

Drizzle the dressing over the entire salad.
